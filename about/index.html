<p>i&rsquo;m friday kriedeman, also known as iluvwerewolves and peroxidee. i&rsquo;m a beginner intermediate pentester, a sophomore at csusb studying ist - cybersecurity with a minor in compsci, and i&rsquo;m a passionate ai enthusiast.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m always on the lookout for new and exciting cybersecurity challenges to tackle. i&rsquo;m a quick learner and i&rsquo;m always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. i&rsquo;m also a team player and i&rsquo;m always willing to lend a helping hand to my fellow cyber warriors.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m looking for an opportunity to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. i&rsquo;m confident that i can be a valuable asset to any team, and i&rsquo;m excited to see what the future holds.</p>
<p>in the meantime, you can find me writing blog posts about cybersecurity, ai, and other nerdy topics. i also enjoy making and listeing to music, reading books, and playing dunegons and dragons.</p>
<p>so what are you waiting for? set sail on this adventure with me and let&rsquo;s explore the world of cybersecurity together!</p>
<p>I hope this is more to your liking.</p>
